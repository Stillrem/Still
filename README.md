**For users of the Enmity app seeking to revitalize their interface by applying personalized themes, the following step-by-step instructions are provided:**

1. **Theme Selection**: The user selects a theme that reflects their taste and mood. Each theme is uniquely named.

2. **Acquiring the Theme Link**: To download a theme, one must obtain a direct link to the theme file. This is done by replacing the asterisks in a standard link with the name of the chosen theme. Example link template: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Stillrem/Still/main/****.json`. The user replaces the asterisks (****) with the name of the theme of interest.

3. **Copying the Link**: Suppose a user selects the "Mint" theme. They modify the template link to `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Stillrem/Still/main/Mint.json` and copy the resulting URL.

4. **Navigating to the Themes Section**: In the Enmity app, the user goes to the section where themes can be managed and new ones can be added.

5. **Adding the Theme**: Here, the user finds the option to add a theme via URL. The copied link is pasted into a designated field, then the choice is confirmed.

6. **Activating the Theme**: After adding, the new theme will be downloaded and appear in the list of available themes. To activate it, the user must find it in the list and toggle the corresponding switch to "on".

7. **Deactivating the Old Theme**: If another theme was previously activated, it is important to ensure it is turned off, as using multiple themes simultaneously may lead to undesirable outcomes.

Upon completing these steps, the new theme will be applied, altering the interface's appearance according to the user's selection. It's crucial to ensure the accuracy of the theme's name entered in the URL to avoid errors during the download. A well-curated and beautifully set theme can significantly enhance the user experience, making the app interaction more enjoyable and personalized.
