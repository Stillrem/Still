To configure a new theme in the Enmity app, users can follow a simple guide. First and foremost, it is necessary to decide on the theme they wish to apply. Subsequently, to obtain the link for the theme file, one must replace the part of the URL that indicates the theme's name with the name of the chosen theme. The structure of the link typically looks like this: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Stillrem/Still/main/THEME_NAME.json`, where `THEME_NAME` should be replaced with the actual name of the theme.

Suppose a user has chosen a theme named "Mint." Consequently, the link to download the theme would appear as follows: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Stillrem/Still/main/Mint.json`. This link should be copied.

Next, within Enmity itself, locate the section responsible for themes and use the feature to add a theme via URL, pasting the copied link there. After confirming the action, the theme will be automatically downloaded and applied to the app's interface.

Users should pay close attention to the accuracy of the theme name entered in the link to avoid errors during the download process.
